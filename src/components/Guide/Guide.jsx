            You can be more specific with your keyword weighting by using the
            following syntax
            <ul>
              <li>
                (keyword:1.5) - will increase the keyword weighting by x1.5 the

                the default weight.

              <li>
                The highest recommended weighting is 1.5 (you can theoretically
                go as high as 2 but this can cause problems as it makes the AI
                to focus too much on this specific part of the prompt).

            []s can also be used to blend two terms together.
            <ul>

                [keyword1:keyword2:0.5] - this will give a slightly biased
                emphasis to keyword1 as it is first in the list.
              </li>
              <li>
                [keyword1:keyword2:0.3] - this will give greater emphasis to
                keyword2

              <li>
                [keyword1:keyword2:0.7] - this will give greater emphasis to

                Or to blend three or more terms together.
                [keyword1|keyword2|keyword3] - this will merge all the terms
                together.
